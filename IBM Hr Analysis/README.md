# IBM HR Analysis

## Project Background

This project focuses on analyzing the [HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data), a collection of over **35 columns of employee-related data and 1k+ entries**. The dataset, known as the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset, contains information on employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status. These data points provide a valuable foundation for understanding the complex factors influencing employee turnover within organizations. The dataset serves as an invaluable resource for exploring the multifaceted factors that drive employee turnover, which remains a critical issue for organizations aiming to retain talent, maintain team cohesion, and reduce operational costs. The goal is to derive insight and uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset. 

To facilitate efficient analysis and align with best practices in relational database design, the dataset was broken down into three separate tables alinging with best practices in relational database deisgn, ensuring logical organization and efficient analysis. By grouping related attributes—for example, separating demographics, job information, and performance metrics—the data structure becomes more focused, reducing redundancy and improving clarity. This approach enhances flexibility for crafting SQL queries, as JOIN operations can easily link relevant tables to explore complex relationships, such as how job satisfaction correlates with attrition. Additionally, this modular design allows for easier updates and scalability, ensuring the database can accommodate future data without disrupting its integrity or structure. **The goal is to derive insight and uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset**

The Objective being to: 

- **Explore Data Relationships**: Analyze correlation between employee demographics , job satisfaction, and attrition rates.
- **Segment Employee Groups**: Understand attrition trends within specific departments, job levels, or work life balance.
- **Salary Observation**: reveal interesting patterns relating to employee salaries and their potential impact.

**SQL Skills Used**: Data Cleaning, Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTE), Window functions, Aggregations, Group By, Data Type Conversion, and Data Transformation
