### **Tech Layoffs Data Cleaning & Standardization**
**Description:**  
This dataset tracks tech layoffs from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to mid-2024. My main goal for this project was to **standardize and clean the dataset** to ensure consistency, improve data quality, and make it ready for further analysis.
