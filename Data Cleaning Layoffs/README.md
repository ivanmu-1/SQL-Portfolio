# Project Overview:

This [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) tracks tech layoffs from when COVID-19 was delcared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, to July 20, 2024

My main goal of this project was to standardize and clean the dataset in order to ensure consistency, improve data quality, and make it ready for further analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing date formats, and ensuring proper categorization of variables. 
By preparing the data in a structured format, I aimed to make it easier to analyze trends and derive meaningful insights regarding the impact of the economic slowdown on tech layoffs
