## Project Overview:

This Kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) tracks tech layoffs from when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, to July 20, 2024. It provides insight into how the economic slowdown brought on by the pandemic affected employment trends across major tech companies. 

### Objective: 

My main goal of this project was to standardize and clean the dataset in order to ensure consistency, improve data quality, and make it ready for further analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing date formats, and ensuring proper categorization of variables. By preparing the data in a structured format, I aimed to make it easier to analyze trends and derive insights regarding the impact of the economic slowdown that Covid-19 had on tech layoffs.

This Data Cleaning Script was developed as an project to build foundational skills in SQL-based data cleaning. The dataset was broken down into multiple stages such as identifying inconsistencies, handling null values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates to demonstrate a step-by-step approach to cleaning and preparing data for analysis. Each stage highlights a specific aspect of the data cleaning workflow, making the process easier to follow and understand.

__SQL Skills Used:__ Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Date Functions, Data Insertion, Data Type Conversion, Removing Duplicates, Table Creation, String Manipulation, Window Functions, Aggregations Joins, Window Functions, and Group By.
